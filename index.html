    I am a mathematics graduate student at <a href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>. I am currently on leave. I am primarily interested in algebraic combinatorics and am advised by <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~williams/">Lauren Williams</a>. Here is my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>.

<h2>On the missing Moore graph</h2>
<p>
    The following numbers enumerate the isomorphism classes of the k-edge subgraphs that appear in a 57-regular graph of order 3250 and girth 5 (if it exists). k = 1: 92625. k = 2: 5187000, 4284462000. k = 3: 95095000, 290472000, 479569272000, 131960098270000. k = 4: 1283782500, 15975960000, 16266432000, 8786778000000, 13415812410000, 26839612800000, 22142456896560000, 3044524117139505000. k = 5: 58094400, 13608094500, 219669450000, 287567280000, 894653760000, 894653760000, 910629720000, 118549611180000, 491468457480000, 1475284050240000, 1501213033320000, 1502107687080000, 405453281753520000, 1238107104834600000, 1238475478520280000, 680734926760728840000, 56124831984915622929000.

<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>
    Why do I have a "My thoughts" section on my academic webpage? I think we often forget how much influence we can really have on each other. By reading this, you are subjecting yourself to the thoughts and ideas that appeared in my mind, despite potentially how far apart we are in space and time. If you can recall a time when a conversation with a friend or something you read while scrolling the internet or a comment by a stranger changed your day or the direction of your life, then you can recognize that you have an unreasonable amount of potential influence on other people. I am choosing to exercise this power here in hopes that this reminder allows you to tell the people that you care about that you love them or to compliment a stranger or to, in any other way, make a wave in the strange ocean we are all connected by. This is something I feel so strongly about that I am choosing to leave this paragraph here at the risk of sounding pretentious and despite it being (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQElzjCsl9o">seemingly</a>) non-mathematical in nature.
